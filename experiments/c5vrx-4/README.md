# C5VRX-4 integrated alpha

One isolated ESP32-C5 receiver project, assembled from the C5VRX-3 range/control
work and the three-bundle Phase8 Unwrap75 experiments. It extends **C5VRX by
Twotoz and the C5VRX contributors**, including Leon Beekveldt's receiver research.

This directory contains its own runtime `main/`, configuration, partition table,
tests and evidence. It does not compile the repository's C5VRX-3 `main/`.
The integration PR changes only `experiments/c5vrx-4/`; merge requires the
operator's explicit approval. Building and publishing a PR alpha is independent
of merging. Current main's existing alpha workflow/flasher can build this project.

## Receiver contract

- MODEM_DIAG packed Q4/I4, positive-edge PARLIO RX at 40 MS/s, raw cyclic ring.
- TX-only Phase8 endpoint decode plus middle-sample quadrant winding; exactly
  three bundles per three input/output bytes. Unique CVBS 13.333 MS/s,
  continuous `[D,D,D]` at a 40 MHz / 40 MB/s physical DAC transport.
- Six original DAC GPIOs and resistor network; no CPU sample-paced output.
- Direct Gain V5 by default: first-window physical correction, 200-us observer,
  descriptor dedupe, table-maximum listening, measured noise lane cap and
  anti-hunt damping. Native AGC remains a separate opt-in gain owner.
- Protected adaptive lanes by default: two fresh overlap windows before a
  one-step finer upgrade; immediate fold escape, 210-us post-switch observation
  exclusion, retained phase state, magnitude-only GPIO routing updates.
  This is not an atomic or tagged hardware handover.
- Severe coarse-lane clipping (>=50%, P95>=95) sends active Direct Gain to G20,
  its existing controller floor. Moderate overload uses staged RF/BB cuts.
  Finer-lane saturation first escapes to coarse. No native/manual gain writes.
- Fixed nominal loaded CVBS transfer: 0.300-V reference + 0.150 V/MHz, nearest
  DAC code with saturation. Frequency headroom does not determine voltage slope.
- Slow sync supervision uses the same stride-3 Phase8/winding transfer estimate,
  instead of the old Phase5 shadow. Snapshot alignment remains approximate.
- AFC V2 measures burst-confirmed sync and burst-free porch, with both endpoints
  valid, bounded/stable 16-window evidence, context/settle/copy refusal and a
  maximum of four 250-kHz acquisition steps. AFC video TRACK is sticky and
  writes nothing while valid; it is independent of gain HOLD. **AUTO defaults
  off**: transmitter reference/sign still need physical calibration.
- PR154 PHY ownership restoration, serialized generation-checked gain writes,
  stale-overload mailbox rejection, reversible pinned PHY/BW/11p/native-hold labs.
- Main's analog-video scanner confidence and centred-RF tie-break are retained.
  They identify candidate channels; a confident scan is not range proof.

## Operator controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `T` | Detector, mapping, lane geometry and gain-owner status |
| `J` | AFC state plus eight bounded sync/IQ snapshots; no actuator |
| `u` | Experimental automatic sync/black level servo, opt-in/reboot; fixed mapping required |
| `M` | Fixed CVBS150 / previous full-span transfer, reboot |
| `Z` | Protected adaptive V5 / fixed ultrafine comparison, reboot |
| `h` | STATIC / bounded HISTORY phase decode, reboot |
| `N` | Direct Gain / native AGC, reboot |
| `H`, `{}`, `[]`, `W`, `B`, `A`, `:`, `L` | PR154 shared PHY diagnostics/labs |
| `(`, `)` | Explicit native-only BB hold / 100-cycle reversible lab |

The lane comparison uses the new NVS key `c5vrx4/force_ultra_v2`; the old
PR146 `force_ultra` setting does not silently force the integrated default.
Other C5VRX-4 settings remain in `c5vrx4`, separate from C5VRX-3 `c5vrx`.
STATIC remains the default; HISTORY and fixed ultrafine are comparisons.
Normal probes are disabled at boot. Lab writes require the pinned PHY archive;
unknown libraries keep observation and refuse undocumented writes.

## Build and verification

```sh
cd experiments/c5vrx-4
python3 verify.py
. "$IDF_PATH/export.sh"  # ESP-IDF v6.0.2
idf.py -DIDF_TARGET=esp32c5 build
```

IDF configuration invokes `verify.py`, so the existing alpha workflow executes
this directory's C regressions, AFC cases, Phase8/routing tests and exhaustive
524,386,048-trajectory oracle before cross-compiling. Host Python 3 and GCC are
required; this verification does not need NumPy, network access or hardware.
Generated tables must match checked-in artifacts. No binaries are committed.
The supervisory task stack is 16 KiB to accommodate the bounded snapshot
analyzer; startup refuses allocation failure. Heap/stack margin under menu and
concurrent J capture still needs hardware observation.

[INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) records PR/issue disposition and acceptance.
[BUG_AUDIT.md](BUG_AUDIT.md) records the complete issue inventory, snapshot/control fixes and remaining hardware acceptance gaps.
[INTEGRATION_SOURCES.json](INTEGRATION_SOURCES.json) pins donor revisions.
[CVBS_OUTPUT.md](CVBS_OUTPUT.md) explains the loaded transfer and scope model.
Earlier research files are donor records; this README defines current defaults.

## Evidence boundary

This is an unmerged test build. Host tests and compiler success do not establish
sample-gapless transport, improved sensitivity/range, PAL/NTSC compliance or
HDZero acceptance. Fixed scaling does not recover phase information lost to
clipping, origin collapse or RF noise. Automatic video level regulation is available only in the `u` lab; it is off
by default pending LUT arbitration/FIFO and HDZero bench acceptance. It corrects
output gain and offset, not IQ DC. H/V regeneration/coasting and CPU raw-ring
sync repair remain absent. See [CVBS_LEVEL.md](CVBS_LEVEL.md) for operation and limits.
