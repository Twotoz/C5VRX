/* C5VRX by Twotoz and contributors: C5VRX-4 sync flywheel.
 *
 * Operator decision 2026-10-05 (AGENTS.md exception): the goggles must never
 * see a moment without valid PAL/NTSC sync. The live path still recovers the
 * transmitted waveform; this only adds the sync pulses the RF lost.
 *
 * It ports the C5VRX-3 flywheel idea (feat/sync-flywheel: PLL line tracker,
 * repair of broken pulses in the raw IQ ring ahead of the TX read) to the
 * C5VRX-4 span75 pipeline, with three changes:
 *   - Detection without demodulation: the 75 ns endpoint phase step
 *     phase[raw[k]] - phase[raw[k-3]] (Phase8 bins; sync ~-38, blanking ~0)
 *     at a few points per line, two table lookups each, valid for any span
 *     alignment. C5VRX-3 demodulated every sample of a window (~0.5 us per
 *     code on the C5) and reached ~1 line in 6.
 *   - Synthesis with a constant phase step per 25 ns sample, so whatever
 *     3-byte grouping the TX BitScrambler uses decodes to the learned sync
 *     (or blanking) step. The wrap residual to the next real sample is
 *     spread over the run, so the edges carry no glitch.
 *   - Vertical sync too: every half-line slot of the vertical interval
 *     (equalizing / broad pulses) is checked against the field timing learned
 *     from real V syncs and rebuilt when missing. Each slot is 32 us, well
 *     inside the ~409 us between the RX write and the TX read.
 * Clean pulses are never written. While the carrier is gone the flywheel
 * keeps coasting (the idle raster takes over after 2 s); when the VTX returns
 * at another phase, two matching full-line scans re-lock it in one step.
 * The colour burst is left alone (HDZero Goggles 2 uses colour-carrier
 * detect for its PAL/NTSC switch). Pure C, host-tested.
 *
 * Line repair (opt-in, operator request 2026-10-06; VCR-style dropout
 * compensation): a line whose active video is mostly implausible phase
 * steps (a short fade or multipath null) is replaced, from just after the
 * burst to just before the front porch, by the same span of the line two
 * (NTSC) or four (PAL) lines earlier - the same colour-subcarrier phase -
 * when that line was clean. The copy is re-phased to the real samples at
 * both ends (no seam glitch). At most SFW_CONCEAL_RUN lines in a row, never
 * in the vertical interval, only bytes not yet read by TX and only from
 * bytes RX has not overwritten (sfw_ring_t.intact_from). This alters picture
 * content: a stale line instead of a noise streak. */
