/* C5VRX by Twotoz and contributors: no-carrier idle raster decision.
 *
 * Strict digital-path goggles (HDZero: TP2825 decoder, deinterlacer, scaler)
 * show a green screen and may switch PAL/NTSC when their decoder sees noise.
 * The HDZero firmware polls TP2825 register 0x01 every ~100 ms: a vertical
 * lock in the other standard on two consecutive polls switches the decoder
 * and display timing, and a fresh lock takes ten polls to count as locked
 * (hd-zero/hdzero-goggle src/driver/hardware-goggle*.c, AV_in_detect).
 * Demodulated receiver noise therefore costs a standard re-detection and a
 * relock when the transmitter appears. Analog modules usually give the
 * goggles a valid raster (their menu) instead.
 *
 * C5VRX-4 emits a clean black raster in the last live standard after a
 * sustained absence of any carrier, and returns to live video as soon as a
 * carrier or a sync is seen. The live path itself is unchanged: this never
 * repairs or regenerates a received picture, and a weak carrier with sync
 * fragments stays live. Pure function, host-tested. */
