## Range / demod research

The current experimental range work measures semantic CVBS sync and the exact-adjacent winding loss hidden by the 50 ns endpoint discriminator. See `docs/range-demod-quality-v2.md` for the measurement model and hardware validation rules.

## Web Flasher (Zero-Install Browser Flashing)

Flash your Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5 directly from your browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera) with zero installation required:

**[Open the C5VRX Web Flasher](https://twotoz.github.io/C5VRX/)**

The production web flasher is hosted entirely by **GitHub Pages** at
[twotoz.github.io/C5VRX](https://twotoz.github.io/C5VRX/). There is no VPS,
application server, or separate production web host in the current deployment.

- **Automatic Latest Firmware**: Automatically selects the newest immutable semantic-version release.
- **One-Click Flashing**: Flashes the universal merged production image (`bootloader + partitions + app` at `0x0`) over Web Serial. Firmware is mirrored into the GitHub Pages artifact and fetched same-origin, so browser CORS redirects are not part of the production flash path.
- **Selectable Releases**: The **Releases** tab contains only semantic-version releases such as `v3.0.0`, `v3.0.1`, and newer.
- **Separate PR Builds Tab**: Same-repository pull requests publish a temporary `pr-<number>` GitHub prerelease. Experimental builds appear only under **PR Builds**, never in the normal Releases list, and require an explicit warning confirmation before flashing.
- **Offline / Local Execution**: You can also run the web flasher locally:
  ```bash
  python tools/open_webflasher.py
  ```
  *(Starts a local HTTP server at `http://localhost:8080/web/index.html` and opens your browser.)*

### Automatic releases and versioning

Every push or merged PR to `main` builds the production firmware and publishes a new immutable GitHub release with a semantic version tag.

- `BREAKING CHANGE` or a conventional-commit `!` creates a **major** bump.
- `feat:` / `feat(scope):` creates a **minor** bump.
- `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, and other changes create a **patch** bump.
- If no stable release exists yet, the current `v3.0.0-rc1` line is promoted to `v3.0.0`.
- The resolved version is written to `version.txt` before the ESP-IDF build, so the firmware metadata and GitHub release use the same version.
- Release assets remain attached to their immutable version tag; the old mutable `main` release/tag is retired automatically after the first versioned release succeeds.

### Website deployment

Firmware releases and website deployment are intentionally separate:

- `.github/workflows/build.yml` validates and builds firmware, then publishes a versioned release after a successful push to `main`. For same-repository PRs it also maintains a clearly marked temporary prerelease (`pr-<number>`) and removes it when the PR closes.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` is the **only production website deployment**. It always checks out trusted `main`, then packages the web flasher plus a generated firmware mirror into one GitHub Pages artifact.
- `tools/prepare_pages_site.sh` mirrors the newest semantic firmware releases and all active `pr-<number>` prereleases under `firmware/<tag>/`, and generates `firmware/releases.json`.
- The browser reads that Pages manifest and downloads binaries from the same `twotoz.github.io` origin. This avoids GitHub Release storage CORS redirects entirely.
- Successful Production CI triggers a Pages mirror refresh, so newly published/updated PR builds and releases become available without deploying unmerged PR web code.
- When a PR closes or merges, CI deletes its temporary prerelease/tag; the next successful cleanup-triggered Pages refresh removes it from the mirror.

## What is C5VRX?

**C5VRX-3** turns the **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5** (ESP32-C5 RISC-V SoC) into a standalone 5.8 GHz analog video (FPV) receiver.

It captures raw Wi-Fi PHY I/Q samples directly from the 5 GHz RF front-end at 40 MS/s, demodulates Wideband FM (WBFM) in real-time hardware using the ESP32-C5 **BitScrambler**, and outputs analog NTSC composite video (CVBS) via **PARLIO TX** and a 6-bit passive resistor DAC ladder into standard 75-ohm FPV goggles or monitors.

```

After startup, the CPU does not process pixels; the entire pipeline runs continuously in dedicated silicon peripherals (AHB GDMA $\to$ BitScrambler $\to$ PARLIO TX).

## Key Innovations & Architectural Highlights

### 1. The Breakthrough: Zero-EOF Circular GDMA
- **The Problem**: In continuous loop mode, the stock ESP-IDF PARLIO TX driver injected a GDMA EOF (`suc_eof = 1`) on every cyclic ring wrap (confirmed in [espressif/esp-idf#19091](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/19091)). This triggered periodic hardware stalls, causing a 1-second vertical sync drop and jagged horizontal line jitter ("kartels").
- **The Solution**: C5VRX-3 patches `dw0.suc_eof = 0` across the descriptor ring in SRAM after driver initialization, paired with 64-byte aligned cache synchronization (`sync_dma_c2m`).
- **The Result**: Truly gapless, infinite circular streaming with zero wrap bubbles, rock-solid vertical sync lock, and crystal-clear horizontal alignment.

### 2. Dual-Loop Adaptive AGC with $Q_{\text{phase}}$ Coherence Tracking
- Eliminates both the erratic hunting of stock packet AGC and the "noise trap" of blind power measurement (where background thermal noise keeps measured power elevated even in deep fades).
- Computes real-time integer FM phase coherence:
  $$Q_{\text{phase}} = \frac{\text{count}(P \ge 8 \land \text{Dot} > 0 \land |\text{Cross}| \le \text{Dot})}{255} \times 100\%$$
- **Dynamic Gain Adaptation**: As signal degrades ($Q_{\text{phase}} < 68\%$ or $P_{\text{median}} < 18$) without clipping, the receiver actively steps RF gain up towards Gain 62 to lift weak carriers above the ADC quantizer floor.
- **Fast Overload Safety Rem**: Instant gain cut ($\Delta G = -4 / -6$) if clipping occurs ($N_{\text{clip}} \ge 4$ and $P_{\text{median}} > 18$).
- **Deadband Lock**: Zero register writes when locked in the clean target zone ($Q_{\text{phase}} \ge 70\%, P_{\text{median}} \in [18, 30]$).

### 3. Fixed BW40 Analog Front-End
- **BW40 is the production RF contract**: C5VRX keeps the wide analog front-end selected with `phy_wifi_fbw_sel(1)` during startup and after every channel retune.
- **No runtime BW20 gearbox**: Earlier hardware testing showed the narrower setting rolls off part of the analog-FM video spectrum, reducing detail and causing chroma instability. The later theoretical "+3 dB survival" gearbox was therefore removed.
- **No bandwidth-switch transient in flight**: Weak-signal recovery is handled by the adaptive gain controller and demodulator/noise handling while RF bandwidth remains fixed.

### 4. Soft-Noise Squelched Phase5 Demodulator
- The `fm.bsasm` BitScrambler program implements soft-noise squelching: phase deltas around $\pm 180^\circ$ (deltas $-16 \dots -12$ and $+13 \dots +15$) are mapped to blanking pedestal (DAC code 20) instead of sync tip (DAC code 0).
- Eliminates false horizontal sync pulses and screen tearing during noise bursts and static.

## Hardware Pinout & Circuit (Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5)

Connect a 6-bit binary-weighted resistor DAC ladder to the XIAO pins, meeting at the `VIDEO` node:

| XIAO Pin | ESP32-C5 GPIO | Bit Weight | Series Resistor |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **D4** | GPIO 23 | Bit 0 (LSB) | 8.2 kΩ |
| **D5** | GPIO 24 | Bit 1 | 3.9 kΩ |
| **D6** | GPIO 11 | Bit 2 | 2.0 kΩ |
| **D7** | GPIO 12 | Bit 3 | 1.0 kΩ |
| **D8** | GPIO 8  | Bit 4 | 470 Ω |
| **D9** | GPIO 9  | Bit 5 (MSB) | 240 Ω |
| **GND** | GND | Ground | Ground reference |

### Recommended Analog Filters:
1. **Shunt Termination**: 200 Ω resistor from `VIDEO` to `GND`. When connected to goggles with standard 75 Ω termination, this forms a matched 0–1.0 V standard CVBS level.
2. **De-Emphasis Filter**: A **470 pF ceramic capacitor** placed in parallel across `VIDEO` and `GND` creates a 10–14 dB high-frequency de-emphasis low-pass filter, dramatically reducing triangular FM noise and snow.
3. **BOOT Button**: The built-in BOOT button (GPIO 28) switches channels on short click. A long press opens the standalone PAL/NTSC menu; short presses move between pages and a long press applies the selected action. On the CHANNEL page, a long press scans all 48 channels and selects the strongest coherent carrier.
4. **Persistent settings**: Channel, RF bandwidth mode, AFC/output/video-standard modes, AGC/manual gain and the BOOT-menu preference are stored in NVS and restored after restart.

## Interactive Serial Console Hotkeys

Connecting to the USB serial console (115200 baud) provides live telemetry and single-key controls:

| Key | Action |
|:---:|:---|
| `c` / `C` | Cycle FPV channel / band (48 standard channels: RaceBand, Boscam A/B/E, FatShark, LowBand) |
| `+` / `-` | Manual RF gain step (±2 index) |
| `a` / `s` / `m` | Switch AGC mode: **Active** (auto-adapting) / **Shadow** (dry-run) / **Manual** (fixed) |
| `f` | Cycle AFC Mode: **Auto Centering** (±1.5 MHz) / **Hold** / **Off** (0 kHz) |
| `,` / `.` | Fine-tune carrier frequency offset in ±50 kHz steps |
| `0` | Reset frequency offset to 0 kHz |
| `e` | Toggle RX sample clock edge (POS / NEG) |
| `d` | Print real-time reception diagnostics summary |

## Build & Flash Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Option A (Docker - Recommended)**: Docker Desktop or Docker engine installed.
- **Option B (Native ESP-IDF)**: [ESP-IDF v6.0.x](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v6.0/esp32c5/get-started/) installed with Python 3.10+.
- **Option C (PlatformIO)**: Python 3.10+ and the pioarduino core fork (`pip install pioarduino`); it fetches the toolchain and ESP-IDF itself.

---

### Step 1: Build the Firmware

#### Option A: Build via Docker (Zero-Install Toolchain)
No ESP-IDF installation required on your host machine. Run from the repository root:

**Linux / macOS / Git Bash:**
```bash
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/workspace" -w /workspace espressif/idf:v6.0.2 idf.py build
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/workspace" -w /workspace espressif/idf:v6.0.2 idf.py build
```

#### Option B: Build with Native ESP-IDF v6.0+
If you have ESP-IDF installed locally:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
idf.py build
```

**Windows (ESP-IDF PowerShell Environment):**
```powershell
export.ps1
idf.py build
```

#### Option C: Build with PlatformIO
`platformio.ini` describes the same ESP-IDF build, so a plain checkout builds without installing a
toolchain first. The official `platformio/espressif32` platform supports neither the ESP32-C5 nor
ESP-IDF 6, so the project pins the community [pioarduino](https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32)
platform at a fixed commit, which requires the pioarduino core fork of PlatformIO:

```powershell
pip install pioarduino
pio run -e xiao_c5
```

On Windows run `pio` from PowerShell or cmd: the ESP-IDF tool installer refuses to run under
MSYS/Git Bash. The first build downloads the toolchain and ESP-IDF v6.0.1 (a few hundred MB) into
`~/.platformio`; `tools/pio_idf_toolchain.py` then selects the exact `riscv32-esp-elf` version that
ESP-IDF 6.0 requires, which is newer than the one the platform ships.

The images land in `.pio/build/xiao_c5/` (`bootloader.bin`, `partitions.bin`, `firmware.bin`, plus a
merged `firmware.factory.bin`). All receiver parameters still come from `sdkconfig.defaults`;
PlatformIO writes the generated configuration to the git-ignored `sdkconfig.xiao_c5`, so delete that
file after editing the defaults. To flash, use `python tools/flash_pio.py` (see Step 3, Option E).

The Docker and native ESP-IDF builds produce three critical binaries in `build/`:
- `build/bootloader/bootloader.bin` (at flash offset `0x2000`)
- `build/partition_table/partition-table.bin` (at flash offset `0x8000`)
- `build/c5vrx3.bin` (at flash offset `0x10000`)

---

### Step 2: Verify Architectural Constraints
Before flashing, run the built-in validator to ensure zero DMA/BitScrambler constraint violations:
```bash
python tools/validate_build.py
```
*(All architectural checks must pass.)*

---

### Step 3: Flash to ESP32-C5

#### Option A: Web Flasher (Zero-Install In-Browser Flasher)
Launch the web flasher directly in your browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave):
**[Open C5VRX Web Flasher on GitHub Pages](https://twotoz.github.io/C5VRX/)**

#### Option B: Zero-Friction Auto-Flash (Python Watcher)
Run the auto-flash watcher:
```bash
python tools/auto_flash.py
```
*Plug in or reset your Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5 into download mode (hold BOOT while tapping RESET), and the watcher will detect the COM port, flash the firmware, and automatically trigger a watchdog reset into the application!*

#### Option C: Direct Flash Script
Specify your COM port (or omit to auto-detect):
```bash
python tools/flash.py COM10
```

#### Option D: Native ESP-IDF Flasher
```bash
idf.py -p COM10 flash
```

#### Option E: PlatformIO Build (Manual Download Mode)
Flashes the images from `.pio/build/<env>/`:
```bash
python tools/flash_pio.py [ENV] [PORT]
```
The XIAO's USB-Serial/JTAG auto-reset is unreliable while C5VRX firmware is running, so the script
writes the flash straight away if the chip is already in the ROM bootloader, and otherwise asks you
to unplug the board, hold BOOT, plug it back in and release BOOT. It always writes DIO at 80 MHz
(the XIAO's flash does not boot in QIO) and never asserts DTR/RTS. `pio run -t upload` works too
when the board is already in download mode.

---

### Step 4: Interactive Serial Monitor & Diagnostics
Launch the dedicated low-latency serial monitor:
```bash
python tools/monitor.py COM10
```
Use the interactive hotkeys (`c` to cycle channels, `+`/`-` for manual gain, `a` for active AGC, `d` for hardware diagnostics).
