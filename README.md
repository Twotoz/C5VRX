## Current firmware

The `main` build defaults to the **Golden Phase5 demodulator**, with the
same CVBS DAC transfer as v3.18.1, and **Direct Gain V5** (Direct Gain V4 below
plus a 200 us observer and anti-hunt damping). This restores the output swing
lost when full-range Phase8 became the default; the smaller signal was reported
to prevent HDZero Goggles AV-in from displaying/recording video.

Full-range Phase8 remains a `menuconfig` experiment
(`CONFIG_C5VRX_PHASE8_HR_LIVE_TEST=y`). It maps -128..+127 phase bins across the
64 DAC levels, compressing normal video amplitude by approximately 3x compared
with Golden. A transition across +/-180 degrees can still alias. See
[CVBS output regression](docs/hdzero-cvbs-output.md) for evidence and the
required hardware check.

Direct Gain V4 is the Direct Gain V3 core (centered Q4 amplitude and Phase8
coherence, physical RF/BB/Fine tuples, zero-write hold while healthy) with two
changes: it acts on the first 1 ms window that leaves the healthy band and
jumps straight to the predicted gain (about 1-2 ms instead of tens to hundreds
of ms), and without a carrier it listens at the gain table's maximum instead of
parking at G62, so weak carriers at the range edge are found.

**Native hardware AGC** remains selectable (RF page, hold BOOT 2 s through the
profile cycle, or serial `N`; applied with a reboot) but is not the default.
Measurements on PR #122 ([native-agc-v2.md](docs/native-agc-v2.md)) show the
ESP32-C5 packet AGC re-acquiring on a continuous carrier every ~21 us, one to
two times per video line, landing on a different gain each time (Q4 radius
41-266 codes for a static VTX). That is the source of the thin black/rainbow
lines and the grain seen with native AGC; finer IQ lanes, register tuning and
paced (timer-gated) native tracking did not remove it. A firmware controller
that holds one gain is the better fit for continuous analog FM.

Bench status: Direct Gain V4 gave a clean picture and very fast response on the
XIAO ESP32-C5 with the VTX static and moving. Range-edge recovery, near-VTX
overload and long sessions still need dedicated tests.

## Demodulator and gain notes

- [Direct Gain V3 design](docs/direct-gain-v3-core.md) describes the Q4
  observer, gain model, settle logic, and known hardware tuning limits that
  Direct Gain V4 builds on.
- [Native AGC findings](docs/native-agc-v2.md) (PR #122): per-sample AGC state
  from the RF dump, the ~21 us re-acquisition cycle, register sweep, DAC
  self-noise, level-offset and paced-native trials, and why none became the
  default. [Paced native AGC](docs/native-agc-paced.md) and the
  [pre-native noise audit](docs/pre-native-noise-audit.md) complete it.
- [Direct Gain V3 measurement oracle](docs/direct-gain-v3-oracle.md) documents
the guarded USB measurements and their interpretation.
- [Range and demod quality](docs/range-demod-quality-v2.md) records the
  measurement model and validation limits for CVBS sync and demod quality.
- [Range v2](docs/range-v2.md), [range notes](docs/range-v2-knowledge.md),
and [trajectory v2](docs/trajectory-v2.md) are research references; their
experimental ideas are not all part of the default live path.
- [Pre-Q4 lab](docs/pre-q4-lab.md) documents explicit RF/DAC noise checks and
vendor gain-table characterization. Those lab actions are not run as part of
normal video reception.

## Web Flasher (Zero-Install Browser Flashing)

Flash your Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5 directly from your browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera) with zero installation required:

**[Open the C5VRX Web Flasher](https://twotoz.github.io/C5VRX/)**

The production web flasher is hosted entirely by **GitHub Pages** at
[twotoz.github.io/C5VRX](https://twotoz.github.io/C5VRX/). There is no VPS,
application server, or separate production web host in the current deployment.

- **Automatic Latest Firmware**: Automatically selects the newest immutable semantic-version release.
- **One-Click Flashing**: Flashes the universal merged production image (`bootloader + partitions + app` at `0x0`) over Web Serial. Firmware is mirrored into the GitHub Pages artifact and fetched same-origin, so browser CORS redirects are not part of the production flash path.
- **Selectable Releases**: The **Releases** tab contains only semantic-version releases such as `v3.0.0`, `v3.0.1`, and newer.
- **Separate PR Builds Tab**: Same-repository pull requests publish a temporary `pr-<number>` GitHub prerelease. Experimental builds appear only under **PR Builds**, never in the normal Releases list, and require an explicit warning confirmation before flashing.
- **Offline / Local Execution**: You can also run the web flasher locally:
  ```bash
  python tools/open_webflasher.py
  ```
  *(Starts a local HTTP server at `http://localhost:8080/web/index.html` and opens your browser.)*

### Automatic releases and versioning

Every push or merged PR to `main` builds the production firmware and publishes a new immutable GitHub release with a semantic version tag.

- `BREAKING CHANGE` or a conventional-commit `!` creates a **major** bump.
- `feat:` / `feat(scope):` creates a **minor** bump.
- `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, and other changes create a **patch** bump.
- If no stable release exists yet, the current `v3.0.0-rc1` line is promoted to `v3.0.0`.
- The resolved version is written to `version.txt` before the ESP-IDF build, so the firmware metadata and GitHub release use the same version.
- Release assets remain attached to their immutable version tag; the old mutable `main` release/tag is retired automatically after the first versioned release succeeds.

### Website deployment

Firmware releases and website deployment are intentionally separate:

- `.github/workflows/build.yml` validates and builds firmware, then publishes a versioned release after a successful push to `main`. For same-repository PRs it also maintains a clearly marked temporary prerelease (`pr-<number>`) and removes it when the PR closes.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` is the **only production website deployment**. It always checks out trusted `main`, then packages the web flasher plus a generated firmware mirror into one GitHub Pages artifact.
- `tools/prepare_pages_site.sh` mirrors the newest semantic firmware releases and all active `pr-<number>` prereleases under `firmware/<tag>/`, and generates `firmware/releases.json`.
- The browser reads that Pages manifest and downloads binaries from the same `twotoz.github.io` origin. This avoids GitHub Release storage CORS redirects entirely.
- Successful Production CI triggers a Pages mirror refresh, so newly published/updated PR builds and releases become available without deploying unmerged PR web code.
- When a PR closes or merges, CI deletes its temporary prerelease/tag; the next successful cleanup-triggered Pages refresh removes it from the mirror.

## What is C5VRX?

**C5VRX-3** turns the **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5** (ESP32-C5 RISC-V SoC) into a standalone 5.8 GHz analog video (FPV) receiver.

It captures raw Wi-Fi PHY I/Q samples from the 5 GHz RF front-end at 40 MS/s, demodulates wideband FM in the ESP32-C5 **BitScrambler**, and outputs analog CVBS through **PARLIO TX** and a 6-bit passive resistor DAC ladder. The video-standard detector supports PAL and NTSC timing.

```

The continuous pixel path runs in AHB GDMA, BitScrambler, and PARLIO TX. A background CPU task observes completed IQ buffers and controls receiver settings; it does not move individual video pixels.

---

## Key Innovations & Architectural Highlights

### 1. The Breakthrough: Zero-EOF Circular GDMA
- **The Problem**: In continuous loop mode, the stock ESP-IDF PARLIO TX driver injected a GDMA EOF (`suc_eof = 1`) on every cyclic ring wrap (confirmed in [espressif/esp-idf#19091](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/19091)). This triggered periodic hardware stalls, causing a 1-second vertical sync drop and jagged horizontal line jitter ("kartels").
- **The Solution**: C5VRX-3 patches `dw0.suc_eof = 0` across the descriptor ring in SRAM after driver initialization, paired with 64-byte aligned cache synchronization (`sync_dma_c2m`).
- **The Result**: Removing the cyclic EOF markers eliminated the observed wrap seams, periodic vertical drops and horizontal jitter in the tested live pipeline. This addresses transport boundaries; RF noise and demodulation artifacts remain separate quality limits.

**Public report and Espressif confirmation:** Leon Beekveldt (Twotoz) reported the continuous-stream problem in [espressif/esp-idf#19091](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/19091) on **16 September 2026**, with a live-hardware A/B comparison. On **17 September**, Espressif's maintainer [confirmed: “Your analysis is correct.”](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/19091#issuecomment-5712811733) and supplied a driver patch. The maintainer explained that BitScrambler interprets cyclic `suc_eof` as a real stream boundary: a steady-state loop should have no EOF, while buffer switching still needs a one-time EOF notification.

This records C5VRX's concrete contribution to a continuous ESP32-C5 RF → IQ → hardware WBFM → CVBS pipeline. The issue concerns **PARLIO/GDMA/BitScrambler stream continuity**, not finite `adctrig` capture or proof that every RF acquisition path is gapless. The earlier autonomous RF-writer and live NTSC milestones are recorded separately in [continuous IQ hardware findings](docs/continuous-iq-findings.md).

### 2. Direct Gain V5 default gain controller
- V5 = V4 plus a 200 us observer cadence (timer-driven, each completed RX descriptor measured at most once) and anti-hunt damping: two direction reversals of consecutive writes within 20 ms make out-of-band decisions need 8 windows (~1.6 ms) for 200 ms. Saturation is never damped.
- **Range lanes:** once the analog gain is at the table maximum and the envelope is still starved, V5 switches the MODEM_DIAG taps to finer ADC bit sets: fine {9,7,6,5} (+6 dB) and ultrafine {9,6,5,4} (+12 dB). Inside their window these are an exact 2x/4x rescale of the coarse nibble (same angle, same Phase8 LUT, no calibration), and the analog gain trims between the 6 dB steps, so total gain is continuous. Without a carrier it listens on ultrafine. Rail codes or incoherent wide junk on a finer lane (the pre-fold warning / a folded strong carrier) return to coarse at once, and lanes are always the first gain removed.
- The fast observer measures centered Q4 P50/P90/P95, phase coherence, clipping, and origin occupancy from completed RX buffers.
- V4 is the sole automatic gain writer in the default profile. It chooses physical RF/BB/Fine gain tuples and verifies each write after its measured settle time.
- Direct: the first window with P50 below 13 or above 32 triggers the full predicted correction in one step; saturation takes an immediate emergency drop.
- Healthy measurements (P50 13-32) produce a zero-write hold, so a steady carrier gets no gain writes.
- Without a carrier it listens at the table maximum rather than the G62 survival gain, so a quantizer-starved weak carrier is not mistaken for no carrier.
- Native hardware AGC is an opt-in alternative (see above).

### 3. Default RF settings
- The default Direct Gain V4 profile uses BW40 and AFC off. This keeps gain as the changing RF control during normal operation.
- Other receiver profiles and lab modes remain selectable over the serial console. Some experimental profiles can use automatic bandwidth or AFC while acquiring a carrier.

### 4. Phase8 adjacent demodulator
- `fm_phase8_hr_live.bsasm` uses adjacent I/Q samples at 20 MS/s and maps the full signed phase-delta range (-128 through +127 bins) across the 64 DAC levels.
- The mapping preserves direction across the signed range. A phase step that crosses the +/-180 degree representation boundary remains ambiguous and can alias.
- Phase8 is selected by default in the current build and was viewed live with Direct Gain V4.

### Known limits
- A signed adjacent-phase estimate cannot distinguish an actual step beyond 180 degrees from its wrapped equivalent.
- The hardware observation documented above covers a working live picture at the tested VTX and receiver setup. It does not establish performance at all distances, channels, antenna orientations, or gain transitions.

## Hardware Pinout (Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5)

Connect a 6-bit binary-weighted resistor DAC ladder to the XIAO pins, meeting at the `VIDEO` node:

| XIAO Pin | ESP32-C5 GPIO | Bit Weight | Series Resistor |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **D4** | GPIO 23 | Bit 0 (LSB) | 8.2 kΩ |
| **D5** | GPIO 24 | Bit 1 | 3.9 kΩ |
| **D6** | GPIO 11 | Bit 2 | 2.0 kΩ |
| **D7** | GPIO 12 | Bit 3 | 1.0 kΩ |
| **D8** | GPIO 8  | Bit 4 | 470 Ω |
| **D9** | GPIO 9  | Bit 5 (MSB) | 240 Ω |
| **GND** | GND | Ground | Ground reference |

### Output network and controls
1. **Video level**: The reference circuit uses a 200 ohm shunt at `VIDEO`; the connected display or goggles may add their own 75 ohm termination. Check the resulting level with the load you use.
2. **Output filter**: The reference circuit uses a 470 pF ceramic capacitor from `VIDEO` to `GND`. Check image sharpness with your display and termination.
3. **BOOT button**: A short click switches channel. A long press opens the menu when enabled; short clicks move through menu choices and a long press applies one. On the CHANNEL page, a long press scans the available channels and selects the strongest coherent carrier. If Safe Flight mode blocks the menu, hold BOOT for three seconds to restore the default Golden/6BIT@40/Direct Gain profile and open the recovery menu.
4. **Persistent settings**: Channel, RF bandwidth, AFC, video-standard/output, AGC/gain, and the BOOT-menu preference are saved and restored after restart.

## Build & Flash Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Option A (Docker - Recommended)**: Docker Desktop or Docker engine installed.
- **Option B (Native ESP-IDF)**: [ESP-IDF v6.0.x](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v6.0/esp32c5/get-started/) installed with Python 3.10+.

---

### Step 1: Build the Firmware

#### Option A: Build via Docker (Zero-Install Toolchain)
No ESP-IDF installation required on your host machine. Run from the repository root:

**Linux / macOS / Git Bash:**
```bash
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/workspace" -w /workspace espressif/idf:v6.0.2 idf.py build
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/workspace" -w /workspace espressif/idf:v6.0.2 idf.py build
```

#### Option B: Build with Native ESP-IDF v6.0+
If you have ESP-IDF installed locally:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
idf.py build
```

**Windows (ESP-IDF PowerShell Environment):**
```powershell
export.ps1
idf.py build
```

The build produces three critical binaries in `build/`:
- `build/bootloader/bootloader.bin` (at flash offset `0x2000`)
- `build/partition_table/partition-table.bin` (at flash offset `0x8000`)
- `build/c5vrx3.bin` (at flash offset `0x10000`)

---

### Step 2: Validate the firmware sources
CI runs the architectural validator and host demodulation checks. To run the repository validator locally:
```bash
python tools/validate_build.py
```
*(All architectural checks must pass.)*

---

### Step 3: Flash to ESP32-C5

#### Option A: Web Flasher (Zero-Install In-Browser Flasher)
Launch the web flasher directly in your browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave):
**[Open C5VRX Web Flasher on GitHub Pages](https://twotoz.github.io/C5VRX/)**

#### Option B: Zero-Friction Auto-Flash (Python Watcher)
Run the auto-flash watcher:
```bash
python tools/auto_flash.py
```
*Plug in or reset your Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5 into download mode (hold BOOT while tapping RESET), and the watcher will detect the COM port, flash the firmware, and automatically trigger a watchdog reset into the application!*

#### Option C: Direct Flash Script
Specify your COM port (or omit to auto-detect):
```bash
python tools/flash.py COM10
```

#### Option D: Native ESP-IDF Flasher
```bash
idf.py -p COM10 flash
```

---

### Step 4: Interactive Serial Monitor & Diagnostics
Launch the dedicated low-latency serial monitor:
```bash
python tools/monitor.py COM10
```
Use the interactive hotkeys (`c` to cycle channels, `+`/`-` for manual gain, `a` for active AGC, `d` for hardware diagnostics).
