 * grab.c - composite video frame grabber on the raw I/Q ring (link mode).
 *
 * FM-demodulates the 40 MS/s Q4/I4 ring in software (phase step between
 * samples from a 256-entry angle table), locks onto the horizontal and
 * vertical sync of the received PAL or NTSC signal with a flywheel on both,
 * and picks GRAB_H interlaced lines of GRAB_W luma pixels out of the active
 * picture: half of the rows from each of two consecutive fields.
 *
 * Everything here is plain C on a byte ring, so test/host/grab_sim.c runs the
 * same code against synthetic video and against raw captures from hardware.
