/* C5VRX by Twotoz and the C5VRX contributors: a goggle-like picture measure
 * for the flight log, the share of expected sync pulses present in the
 * demodulated video of one IQ window.
 *
 * FIELD_DIAG video_pct counts a control window only when the AFC can measure
 * it: a stationary envelope and timing-confirmed sync and porch pairs within
 * ~3 lines. Fading, a gain write or one noisy sync fails the whole window,
 * and the edge read 20-40 % where the operator saw a clean picture (walk 296,
 * -85..-90 dBm; FINDINGS 2026-10-27: windows called lost held clean syncs
 * through the decoder). A goggle's line PLL rides through missing syncs, so
 * this counts them one by one, with none of the AFC's gates.
 *
 * The window is decoded in software with the live decoder's LUT16 (the
 * pair/state rule of the TX BitScrambler, research/sim.py _pair_codes): one
 * DAC code per byte pair at 20 MS/s, then a 4-pair sum (~5 MHz, the goggle
 * filter). Sync tip and blanking differ with the deviation (P64 and U85Q:
 * tip ~12-16, blanking ~25 codes at deviation 0.66), so the slicer sits
 * halfway between the 3rd percentile and the median. A pulse is >= 2 us low
 * (horizontal 4.7 us, VBI equalising and broad pulses too); pulses within
 * 0.7 line of each other count once.
 *
 * One decoding pass: the slicer comes from the previous window's histogram
 * (the levels do not change in a control tick), this window's histogram sets
 * the next one; a window without a slicer is not counted (found and expected
 * 0). No buffer, so no heap. The control task shares priority 3 with the gain
 * observer: PICTURE_YIELD() runs every PICTURE_YIELD_PAIRS so the observer
 * waits at most ~0.25 ms (board: ~3.8 ms wall per window with two passes and
 * no yield). Host test: test/test_picture_sync.py (against a NumPy reference
 * on simulated windows, both decoders). */
